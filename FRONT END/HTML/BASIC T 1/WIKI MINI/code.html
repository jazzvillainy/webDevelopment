        <p>Code refers to the written instructions
            or statements that programmers create using a<a href="programming.html"> programming language</a>  to tell a computer what to do
            We can write our code using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your
            computer.
            While a text editor gives us basic features like syntax highlighting and text formatting, they lack more
            advanced development tools. Example of which are Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), or Sublime
            Text.
            While IDEs are specialized software platforms designed for software development. They typically include
            features like code editing, syntax highlighting, debugging tools, version control integration, and project
            management capabilities
            In this course we would be using a popular IDE called Visual Studio Code but you are free to use any
            other popular option.</p>
