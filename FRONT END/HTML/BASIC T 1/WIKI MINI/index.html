        <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web
            applications that you see and interact with on the internet. It involves writing <a href="code.html"> code</a>,
            designing layouts, and organizing information to create functional and visually appealing
            online experiences. In simpler terms, it's like constructing and decorating a digital space
            where people can visit, explore, and do things like shop, read, or connect with others.</p>

        <summary><b>Who are web developers?</b></summary>
        <details>
            Web developers are the architects and builders of the internet (World Wide Web). They are
skilled professionals who create websites and web applications that you see and use every day.
In simple terms, they write <a href="code.html"> code</a> to bring web designs to life, making sure everything works
smoothly and looks good on your screen. They might work on the visible parts that you interact
with (front-end development) or the behind-the-scenes logic and databases (back-end
development), or even both (full-stack development). Essentially, we are the ones who make the
web work!

        <summary><b>Web development And Its Different Components</b></summary>
        <details>
            Web development involves several key components, each playing a crucial role in creating
functional and visually appealing websites and web applications. Here are the main
components:
1. FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT:
This refers to the process of creating the visual and interactive elements of a
website or web application that users directly interact with in their web browsers. It
involves using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface
and functionality of web pages. Below is a brief explanation about these languages
● HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Defines the structure and
content of web pages.
● CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styles the layout, appearance, and
presentation of HTML elements.
● JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, such
as animations, form validation, and interactive features.
