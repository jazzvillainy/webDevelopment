        <p>A programming language is a formal set of instructions or commands used to communicate with
            a computer. It provides a way for programmers to write code (code refers to the written instructions
            or statements that programmers create using a programming language to tell a computer what to do)
            that the computer can understand and execute. Programming languages have syntax rules and
            conventions that dictate how code is structured and written.
            Overall, programming languages serve as the intermediary between human programmers and
            computers, enabling the creation of software, applications, and systems to solve a wide range of
            problems and automate various tasks.</p>
